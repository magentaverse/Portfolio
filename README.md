# About me
Hello! I'm Joanna Szaban, an aspiring junior software tester. While I initially pursued a career in project management and gained a decade of experience, my true passion lies in the dynamic world of software testing.

With a degree from the Medical University of Warsaw, Poland, I've developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and attention to detailâ€”qualities that I believe are vital for effective software testing. My journey into the world of IT stems from my fascination with new technologies and my desire to contribute to creating reliable and user-friendly software.

My goal is to transition my skills and knowledge into the realm of software testing. I'm dedicated to continuously expanding my testing expertise and technical skills. Through personal studies and research, I'm actively building a toolkit of testing techniques and methodologies.

I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals, contribute to delivering high-quality software, and embrace the challenges that come with ensuring a seamless user experience. Let's connect and embark on this testing journey together!
